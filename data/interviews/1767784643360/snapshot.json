This will be a conversation about how you’re using ChatGPT Enterprise in your day-to-day work — what you use it for, what’s working well, what’s challenging, and what impact you’ve seen. Please keep examples high-level and avoid any confidential details. Take your time — pauses are fine. If you’re thinking, you can say ‘give me a second’ and I’ll wait. Are you happy to continue?",
