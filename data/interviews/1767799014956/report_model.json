      "User is a Customer Success Manager using ChatGPT Enterprise most days (4/5) primarily for writing-heavy workflows: customer follow-ups, QBR prep, success plans, and internal updates.",
      "Biggest impact is faster turnaround and clearer, more consistent structure; reported time savings are ~2–5 hours/week with meaningful lift (impact 4/5).",
      "Primary workflow is notes → structured recap → action plan → customer email, with human review for tone/accuracy and redaction of specifics before sending.",
      "Main constraint is handling sensitive/precise content (customer specifics, contract language); user avoids including those details and rates this friction as workable but slowing (3/5).",
